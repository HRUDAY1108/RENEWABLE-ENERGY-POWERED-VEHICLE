Renewable Energy Powered Vehicle with Obstacle Avoidance System
Project Overview

This project presents the design and development of a renewable energy powered vehicle integrated with an obstacle detection and avoidance system. The objective is to combine sustainable energy utilization with basic autonomous functionality to create an eco-friendly and intelligent mobility prototype.

The vehicle operates using solar energy as its primary power source and uses embedded control logic to detect obstacles and respond automatically in real time.

Problem Statement

Most conventional vehicles depend on non-renewable energy sources and contribute to environmental pollution. Additionally, affordable smart automation systems are not widely available in low-cost vehicle platforms.

This project addresses:

Dependence on fossil fuels

Environmental impact of traditional vehicles

Lack of basic automation in small-scale vehicle systems

Solution Approach

The system integrates renewable energy generation with embedded automation. The major components include:

Solar panel for energy generation

Rechargeable battery for energy storage

Microcontroller-based control system

Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection

Motor driver module

DC motors for vehicle movement

The ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors the distance in front of the vehicle. If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the controller takes corrective action such as stopping or changing direction to prevent collision.

Technologies Used

Embedded C / Arduino programming

Microcontroller platform

Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

Solar panel and battery system

Motor driver module (L298N or equivalent)

DC motors

Working Principle

The solar panel converts sunlight into electrical energy.

The generated energy is stored in a rechargeable battery.

The microcontroller continuously reads distance data from the ultrasonic sensor.

When an obstacle is detected within a threshold distance, the controller sends appropriate signals to the motor driver.

The vehicle either stops or changes direction.

If no obstacle is detected, the vehicle continues moving forward.
