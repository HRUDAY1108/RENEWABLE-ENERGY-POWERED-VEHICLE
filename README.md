# RENEWABLE-ENERGY-POWERED-VEHICLE
Renewable Energy Powered Vehicle with Obstacle Avoidance is a solar-powered prototype designed to reduce fossil fuel dependency while enabling basic autonomous navigation. Using a microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors, the vehicle detects obstacles in real time and automatically stops or changes direction to prevent collisions.
